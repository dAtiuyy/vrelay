# vrelay

A man-in-the-middle proxy server for the Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) private server Valor. Features packet editing/hooking, a framework to write custom plugins, QoL plugins such as predictive autonexus, and data science-based scripts to autoupdate `vrelay`. Also contains patched exploits that can be generalized to any multiplayer game.

## How to update vrelay?
[A README in the `updater` folder](https://github.com/dAtiuyy/vrelay/tree/main/updater) explains what and how to update.

## How to use `vrelay`?

1. Install Python [64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dAtiuyy/vrelay.git`
3. `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `py proxy.py` to start the proxy server.
5. Obtain a way to force the Valor client to connect to localhost. The easiest way to achieve this is to follow instructions in [updater](https://github.com/swrlly/vrelay/tree/main/updater).
5. In Valor, connect to the proxy server in the server list and you're good to go.

## How to write my own plugins?
[A README in the `plugins` folder](https://github.com/dAtiuyy/vrelay/tree/main/Plugins) explains the necessary steps for writing plugins.

## Features

Watch this video for a demonstration of some vrelay features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9N08Xuop4g

**Toggles**

Each feature has a toggle key as shown in the image above. Keys will only be registered if your focused window is the game.

- `F1` - **Predictive Autonexus**: If you take damage that will put you under a certain threshold, you automatically join the nexus.
    - Accounts for most AoE's except for enemies with 2+ same color throws.
- `F2` - **Godmode**: Immune to all bullet and ground damage. Does not block AoE damage.
- `F3` - **No projectile**: Hides all projectiles from appearing; essentially another godmode (but very obvious to others as you do not know where to dodge).
    - Does not hide AoE damage (you will still take damage from AoE). 
- `F4` - **Speedy**: Apply speedy to yourself!
- `F5` - **Swiftness**: Apply swiftness (stronger form of Speedy) to yourself! Stacks with Speedy.
- `F6` - **Remove client-side debuffs**: This will remove client-side debuffs one tick after they are applied. These will not remove server-sided debuffs like bleeding, quiet, etc.
- `ESC`: Shutdown all plugins.

**Player commands**

- `/dep`: deposit all potions into your potion storage. Can use this in any map.
- `/an #`: set autonexus % between 0 and 99. Enter only integers.
    - `/an help` in game to see the syntax.
- `/safe`: disable all commands shown above and autonexus messages.
